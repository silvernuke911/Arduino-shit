! Read the docs on main.cpp !
=======================================================!

Actually, 
Read the docs on all the cpp files.
It has all the information you would need.

Especially read the docs on:
    globals.cpp 
    main.cpp 

All technical files and links can be found there. 

Also there's a caution warning of the problems 
I encountered for the air quality sensor
on calib.cpp, read that to work on the problem 
I suppose. Good luck.

For finding functions, refer to the .h files.

Most of this code was done by real human hands.
But deepseek helped on debugging and the documentation.
I aint writing allat. 

Anw, Good fucking yard!
