=======================================================!

Actually, 
Read the docs on all the cpp files.
It has all the information you would need.

Especially read the docs on:
    globals.cpp 
    main.cpp 

All technical files and links can be found there. 

For finding functions, refer to the .h files.

most of this code was done by real human hands.
but deepseek helped on debugging and the documentation.
I aint writing allat. 

Anw, Good fucking yard!
